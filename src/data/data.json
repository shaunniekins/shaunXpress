Unfortunately, the outcome was quite messy and left me with negative thoughts. It also triggered a series of stressful events in a very short span of time. I suppose that was to be expected, given that this confusing for me and to the people around me. And yet, here I am, contemplating doing it again. Maybe this time it will turn out well? Hahahahahahahaha."

Consequently, I lose my words and find it difficult to express myself. If given the chance, I would simply leave this life, hoping that my burdens would dissipate along with it. I yearn to be authentic, but it feels as though the world doesn't want me to be."

But why should I care about their opinions? Honestly, I'm uncomfortable being the subject of someone's discussion. I always feel like their opinions matter, even now. I can't fully see myself as someone who lives authentically and does what I truly want, and that's frustrating. It's always about the 'people.' Taking a step away from this mindset feels chaotic, as if it may seem. I feel stressed, especially considering what I believe about life. Do other people share the same ideas as I do? Why is it that I constantly feel the need to be accepted by everyone instead of accepting myself for who I truly am?"

Even when simply watching, it's not uncommon to observe the joy, laughter, and unified shouts of celebration when a goal is achieved. Regardless of their differences, everyone becomes united.\nIf we were to compare this to our daily lives, instead of focusing on our differences, perhaps the world would be a better place."

			"post": "So, I admit that I have been acting childish lately. I've been developing feelings for someone, or maybe just engaging in conversations with people I'm interested in, and perhaps even making fun of others' feelings without considering the impact it could have on them or myself. Now, as I reflect on my actions, it's clear to me that I have been immature and childish in this regard. I've lost sight of the discipline I used to practice and forgotten the kind of person I should strive to be. Upon thinking, reflecting, and taking the time to ponder this whole mess, I am deeply sorry to those I have wronged. I have been stressed and burdened by my personal life, and I may have unintentionally projected my frustrations onto others in an attempt to make myself feel better. I now realize that this was a mistake. So, once again, I sincerely apologize to the people I have hurt or treated insensitively, as it was never my intention.\nFurthermore, during the time I have had to wind down and reflect, I have come to the realization that I am not ready for a serious commitment in a relationship. Perhaps I was just feeling lonely and thought that being in a relationship would alleviate that feeling, but it turns out it doesn't work that way. Liking someone is not the same as loving them. (This is the reality.)\nTherefore, I am acknowledging my mistake and actively working on improving myself so that when the time is right and the Lord blesses me with the right person, I will also be prepared to be a better one. ðŸ™‚"

It's funny how you're not sure if you'll click with them at first, but once the conversation gets going, it feels like catching up with an old friend. It's incredible to uncover just how alike we all are and how much we share in common with those around us. And the best part? Creating meaningful connections with people you've just met is so fulfilling. Those simple interactions with others can truly uplift our souls!"

Sometimes, I doubt my ability to be an effective teacher for these kids. There are also moments of frustration with them (kay di gyud maminaw hahaha). \n\nHowever, on the brighter side, there is a great sense of fulfillment in being able to share the 'good news', teach Bible stories and lessons, and have fun with them. I'm grateful to have this role and to give back something. It not only helps the kids but also contributes to my personal growth. It helps me build my confidence and ability to communicate with people. The good things you do really pay back in good ways.\n\nFulfillment doesn't stem from self-satisfaction, but from the deeds we share in collaboration.\n\n(The pictures are from different times.)\n\n#saturdayministry\n#extensionclass"

It's not just about achieving educational goals; it's about the things that used to bring me genuine happiness. I find myself increasingly absorbed in meaningless content, thoughts, decisions, and actions.\n\nThe transition from childhood innocence to adulthood has made me acutely aware of the weight of my experiencesâ€”the positive, the negative, the regrets, and the consequences of past choices. I've made decisions that weren't always wise, and my impulsive nature has become a burden I carry. I no longer recognize the person I once was. I mistakenly believed that wisdom and maturity would come solely from certain accomplishments, but I've come to understand that true growth necessitates enduring more pain, heartbreak, and failure in life. It is within these challenging moments that one truly learns and evolves. Often, the achievement of something positive comes at a cost.\n\nExternally, others perceive me as someone to admireâ€”a leader, a kind personâ€”but deep down, I am aware of hidden secrets and the weight of guilt that eats away at me. The good I do does not outweigh the burden of the mistakes I hold onto.\n\nWho am I truly? Why do my actions fail to align with the faith I possess? It feels as though I am torn between reaching for the light with one hand while clinging to the darkness with the other. I struggle to determine who I should be, or even who I could be."
